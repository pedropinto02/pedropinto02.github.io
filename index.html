					<h1>Pedro Pinto</h1>
					<p class="major">
						<p>I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from the University of 
							Michigan Ann Arbor. Growing up, I witnessed the development and technical breakthroughs of reusable 
							rockets, private spaceflight, robotic interplanetary exploration, sustainable 
							transportation, and more. This led me to develop a strong passion for engineering, a desire to push the 
							boundaries of what is possible, and to create a lasting impact on society. 
						</p>
						<p>Throughout my extensive work experiences in the aerospace
							and automotive industries, I have gained skills and perspectives in many aspects of engineering, 
							including design, simulation/analysis, software, and 
							manufacturing. This portfolio details those, as well as some of the other projects that I have worked on.

							Long Beach, CA (May 2023 - Aug 2023, May 2024 - July 2024)
						</p>
						<p> Further solidifying my previous experience in simulation/analysis, here
							I developed a convection tool and GUI that allowed for various input parameters and geometries,
							implemented a simulation post processing tool for obtaining the heat flow between subgroups, conducted
							research into aft end protection and ullage diffuser effects on propellant tanks, and modeled
							the transient buildup of frost on the exterior of the launch vehicle. 
							I also created and analyzed thermal models of the Terran R throttle valve actuator, electrical cables, 
							and thermal protection system.

						<h2>Rivian / Aerothermal Systems Engineer Intern</h2>
						<p>
							Irvine, CA (May 2022 - Aug 2022)
						</p>
						<p> I evaluated heat management with composite materials and the associated potential range improvements for EDV and R1S.
							In addition, I automated a StarCCM+ simulation workflow, reducing the number of steps by 66%. 
							Furthermore, I developed a long term insulation pack for human comfort by optimizing insulation location, geometry, material, and thickness; 
							this solution was used in 15,000 vehicles. It took into
							account various factors, including forced convection from external airflow, the varying solar heat load thoroughout the day, and the cargo door. 
							I also determined evaporator cooling power required for varying ambient conditions, for human comfort/safety in EDV cargo compartment.
							Finally, I quantified the benefits of different EDV roof colors, and conducted material stack configuration and fan characterization testing. 
							This was a great experience in approaching and reducing complex problems comprehensively, in order to fully understand and explore the entire design
							space when searching for a solution.

						<p> I streamlined the Model Y fascia assembly line and reduced the cycle time using process flow layouts and time studies.
							I also designed and assembled quality inspection light fixtures, as well as a 2QPC buffer storage method to accommodate urgent process needs.
							I established standard work procedures for the front and rear fascia assembly process, trained operators, and supported production teams. 
							Finally, I presented and coordinated a major design change review for the assembly line, reducing finished goods transfer time by 70%.
							I learned a lot about managing and balancing the diverse goals and requirements of multiple stakeholders.

						<p>
							Troy, MI (June 2021 - Jan 2022)

						<p> I conducted Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) on headlamps and taillamps. 
							I also employed CAD and DFM principles to model plastic/metal components and enclosures, as well as improve the aesthetics and structural stiffness of proposed products. 
							In particular, I designed, assembled, and validated a green filter taillamp prototype which was adopted by GM as a benchmark/proof of concept, 
							resulting in $100,000 additional market value revenue. Highlights included designing the housing, carrier board, mechanical PCB layout, and
							heat sink for this application, as well as 
							conducting optical/colorimetry testing. Overall, I learned how to own a product from start to end of

						<h2>Satellite Constellation Network Analysis</h2>
						<p> Analysis of the connectivity and network topology between existing satellite constellations
							(Iridium and Starlink), to assess relay optimization, robustness, and latency.
							This is accomplished by determining the connectivity and weighted undirected adjacency matrices
							for the network at a given moment in time, assuming that the Earth is the only
							obstruction to line of sight to intersatellite communication. This involved processing TLE data and propagating
							the orbits using the Keplerian elements using MATLAB to determine each position and speed. The network uses
							satellite positions as nodes, connections as edges, and simulates a dynamic
							model of network behavior to obtain the centrality and relative importance of each node.

						<h2>Microstructure Characterization of Additively Manufactured Steel</h2>
						<p> This research project involved image processing EBSD scans of additively manufactured stainless steel. 
							This involved characterization and data analysis of the microstructure (grain and pores) 
							using MTEX. 
							The pore distribution, diameter, sphericity,
							volume, and connectivity by number of adjacent grains were analyzed.  
							Methods (using connected components and voxels) used were successfully validated
							by checking smaller sections. The results enable understanding and visualization of overall 
							sample microstructure and statistics, and also assist in identification of regions of interest.

							Literature reviews were conducted to incorporate nanoscale emitters 
							that can achieve higher thrust densities and exploit geometric trends. 
							A microthruster was proposed/sized to meet mass, thrust, specific impulse, and input voltage specifications for a lunar cubesat.

							minimized rotational inertia and traversal time, and had a relatively low transmission angle deviation. 
							Calibration was performed using a limit switch and accounted for hysteresis.

						<h2>Sartorius / Mechanical Engineering Intern </h2>

							Ann Arbor, MI (May 2024 - Aug 2024)
						</p>
						<p> At Sartorius, I contributed to the development and optimization of the Incucyte, a live-cell imaging instrument used in biomedical research. My responsibilities included design and manufacturing, as well as organizing torque specifications for all screws to ensure consistent assembly across the team.
							I used SolidWorks to design 3D components and created 2D drawings and Bills of Materials (BOMs) for various subassemblies. I also participated in prototyping and subassembly builds, identifying and resolving issues before full-scale production. 
							In addition, I supported bi-weekly testing of new fiber optics, using lasers of various wavelengths to assess long-term performance and stability.

						<h2>University of Michigan / Student Researcher</h2>
						<p>
							Ann Arbor, MI (Jan 2024 - May 2024)
						</p>
						<p> In this research project, I worked on the computational optimization of joining surfaces between a megacast platform and additively manufactured parts for field repair. The research was conducted in 2D to validate the method before scaling to 3D. I modified MATLAB and COMSOL-based MTO code to simulate joint performance and stress distribution, starting with a beam and then a topology-optimized geometry. Results showed that optimized joints could improve on-site repair using CNC machining or metal 3D printing, with strong potential for military and industrial applications. This work led to an abstract that was presented at the ASME 2024 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE2024).

						<h2>INEGI / Engineering Intern</h2>
						<p>
							Porto, Portugal (Jan 2023 - Jul 2023)
						</p>
						<p> I conducted finite element simulations on double-double composite laminates to evaluate their effectiveness in measuring fracture toughness at ply interfaces. This involved validating a DCB model in ABAQUS and developing Python scripts for post-processing. I used the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) to study delamination behavior and analyze the effects of ply thickness, stacking sequences, and repetition on mode mixity. I also performed a detailed literature review on laminate behavior and fracture mechanics. This internship provided end-to-end experience in FEA and composite analysis. The work contributed to a paper recently submitted for publication in the journal Composite Structures.

						<h2>4-Cylinder Engine</h2>
						<p> This project, completed as part of the Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing course, involved creating a four-cylinder engine to showcase its rotational and translational movements. All components, including the crankshaft, connecting rod, piston, camshafts, and valves, were designed using technical drawings. After developing the individual parts, I assembled the full engine and produced 2D drawings, an exploded view, and an animation demonstrating its operation.

						<h2>Stress Analysis of the Gymnastics Men’s High Bar During a Giant Swing</h2>
						<p> As part of the ME511 Solid Continua course, I conducted a structural analysis project focused on the stresses experienced by a gymnastics high bar during a “giant” swing. The study applied both analytical and computational approaches to evaluate bar deflection and bending stress at the most critical phase of the motion. Beam theory was used to estimate forces based on simplified loading, while a finite element model was developed in ABAQUS to simulate real-world behavior. This project strengthened my skills in structural mechanics and FEM analysis.

						<h2>Quenching and Tempering of F10 steel</h2>
						<p> This project, completed as part of the Metallic Materials course, focused on studying the effects of heat treatments on F10 steel. Based on TTT diagrams and tempering curves, I helped plan the heat treatment process and predicted its effects on hardness and microstructure. The practical phase involved executing both heat treatments and analyzing results through Vickers hardness testing and optical microscopy. Sample preparation included progressive grinding on abrasive discs and chemical etching with nitric acid to reveal the steel’s grain structure. The final analysis compared experimental data with predictions, reinforcing my understanding of microstructural evolution under thermal treatments.

						<h2>CNC Machining of an Aluminum Crankshaft</h2>
						<p>
							As part of the Manufacturing Processes II course, this project involved CNC milling a 6061 aluminum crankshaft inspired by the internal mechanism of a classic mechanical pencil sharpener. I used Fusion 360 for both CAD and CAM, with a focus on efficient setup planning, toolpath optimization, and clamping strategies. Although the part was more suitable for turning, I adapted the design for milling to meet project requirements. This project improved my practical understanding of CAD/CAM workflows, CNC setup, and machining techniques.

						<h2>Gymnastics</h2>
						<p> 
							I decided to take up gymnastics in my senior year of undergrad and joined a club team in Porto. When I moved to the United States, I continued training and began competing with the University of Michigan’s club gymnastics team. I traveled across the country for competitions and earned medals in both parallel bars and floor exercise.  While I’m no longer competing, I continue to train regularly and hope to join another club in the future.

						<h2>Piano</h2>
						<p> 
							I began playing the piano at the age of six and deepened my commitment to music when I enrolled in the Conservatory of Music of Porto just before high school. During my time at the conservatory, I performed in national recitals and participated in in-house solo piano competitions, earning second place during my junior year of high school. I continued to play throughout college and, during my senior year, spent a year teaching piano to children at CLIP Oporto International School. Although I have since stepped away from the competitive side of performance, I still play the piano regularly for personal enjoyment.
